            <p>To help us make the 000FFF website a positive place for everyone, we've been using the <a
                    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a>. These
                guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user
                friendly for everyone.</p>

            <p>The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). Weâ€™ve chosen Level AA as the target
                for the 000FFF website.</p>

            <p>We've worked hard on the 000FFF website and believe we've achieved our goal of Level AA accessibility. We
                monitor the website regularly to maintain this, but if you do find any problems, please get in touch.
