            </ol>

                    written “Change Order” describing the requested changes in detail. Within seven (7) days of
                    receiving a Change Order, 000FFF will respond with a statement setting out 000FFF’s
                    availability, additional fees, changes to delivery dates or milestones, and any required
                    modification to the Agreement. 000FFF will be entitled to charge for evaluating each Change
                    Order at its standard rates.</li>
                <li>Acceptance/Rejection: Client will have seven (7) days to respond in writing accepting or

                <li>000FFF’s response may be for a change to the Project price or for the additional work to be
                    carried out on a time and materials basis.</li>
                <li>000FFF shall not begin work on the revised services until it receives written acceptance of its
                    proposals for the change.</li>
            </ol>
        
        <h3>Timing and delays</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Timing: 000FFF will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the Services within the
                    time(s) identified in the Proposal. Client agrees to review Deliverables within the time
                    identified for such reviews and to promptly either, (i) approve the Deliverables in writing or
                    (ii) provide written comments and/or corrections sufficient to identify the Client’s concerns,
                    objections or corrections to 000FFF. 000FFF shall be entitled to request written clarification
                    of any concern, objection or correction. Client acknowledges and agrees that 000FFF’s ability to
                    meet any and all times is entirely dependent upon
                        Client’s prompt performance of its obligations to provide materials and written approvals
                        and/or instructions pursuant to the Proposal and that any delays in Client’s performance or
                        changes in the Services or Deliverables requested by Client may delay delivery of the
                        Deliverables. Any such delay caused by Client shall not constitute a breach of the Agreement
                        by 000FFF.</li>
                <li>Client Delays. Any delay by Client will result in a day-for-day extension of the due date for
                    all Deliverables.</li>
            </ol>
        
        <h3>Evaluation and acceptance</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Approval Periods: Client, within seven days of receipt of each Deliverable, shall notify 000FFF,
                    in writing, of any failure of such Deliverable to comply with the specifications or requirements
                    in the Proposal, or of any other objections, corrections, changes or amendments Client wishes
                    made to such Deliverable. Any such written notice shall be sufficient to identify with clarity
                    any objection, correction or change or amendment and 000FFF shall be entitled to request written
                    clarification of any concern, objection or correction. 000FFF will correct any errors in a
                    commercially timely manner. Any changes or amendments shall be subject to the terms of the
                    Agreement. In the absence of such notice from Client, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted.
                </li>
            </ol>
        
        <h3>Client responsibilities</h3>
        <p>The Client shall:</p>

                    <li>The Client acknowledges that certain services may involve the licensing of third-party
                        intellectual property rights and that the Client may from time to time be required to enter
                        into a licence directly with such third-party. The Client hereby acknowledges that certain
                        services rely upon services being provided by third-parties (‘Third-Party Services’).</li>
                    <li>The Client acknowledges that the Third-Party Services will be governed by the third-parties’
                        terms and conditions and that 000FFF cannot provide any warranties in respect of the
                        Third-Party’s Services and will not be liable to the Client for any delays and/or failings

                    <li>Providers of Third-Party Services may provide their own warranties to the Client and the

                        the client’s business purposes or risk management policies.</li>
                    <li>Third-party media expenses may be incurred as part of supplying the Services, and fall with
                        term 4.3 of this Agreement. These third party expenses include, but are not limited
                        to;&nbsp;influencer fees and design services.</li>
                    <li>All third-party software systems and utilities used to provide the Services remain the
                        property of their respective owners and creators and as such are subject to their own
                        licensing and intellectual property terms and conditions to which you must fully agree.</li>
                </ol>
            
            <h3>Performance guarantees</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Client acknowledges and agrees that the internet is neither owned nor controlled by any
                        one entity; therefore, 000FFF can make no guarantee on the results that may be provided from
                        carrying out the Services. </li>
                    <li>000FFF does not warrant that the outcome of the Services will meet the Client’s requirements
                        or that the operation of the outcome of the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free.
                    </li>
                    <li>In no event, will 000FFF be liable to the Client or any third party for any damages,
                        including any lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special
                        damages arising out of the operation of or inability to operate the Services, even if 000FFF
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</li>
                    <li>000FFF cannot accept responsibility for any variation in the performance of the Client’s
                        website due to seasonality, competitor activity, design and usability and other marketing
                        conditions outside 000FFF’s control.</li>
                    <li>The Client acknowledges and agrees that 000FFF has no control over future algorithms created
                        by Google or other search engines or policy changes by Google or other search engines, but
                        000FFF do undertake various checks and techniques to try to ensure that the risk of a future
                        penalty by Google or other search engines is minimised. It is essential that the Client
                        informs 000FFF of any link building or digital advertising that the Client may carry out
                        independently; as these may carry risks of a manual penalty by Google or other search
                        engines if the source of the link is from a site that is known for using spam techniques or
                        accepting payments for links.</li>
                    <li>The performance of a Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) provided as part of the Services
                        relies on the Client implementing any technical recommendations and/or uploading new
                        optimised content within a timely manner (typically 2-4 weeks). Any delay in carrying out
                        these tasks may seriously impact the effectiveness of a project and could even result in a
                        drop in rankings. Delays may also hold up later phases of the project. </li>
                    <li>For&nbsp;PR and/or social media projects provided within the Services; the timing and
                        placement of the Client content on third party and media sites cannot be guaranteed.
                        &nbsp;The performance therefore of the project will be judged against the agreed plan of
                        activities to create and place content, (as well as our knowledge of the journalists and
                        influencers in each sector).</li>
                </ol>
            
            <h3>Limitation of liability</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Client shall be responsible for checking any material submitted by 000FFF to the Client
                        for approval. The Client shall approve such material or notify 000FFF if any such material
                        is false or misleading or is in any way contrary to law or any applicable UK or EU
                        regulation or law. &nbsp;If no approval or notification is given by the Client within any
                        required time limit (or in the absence of any time limit within a reasonable time) following
