    <h1>Why we charge for proposals</h1>

<p>
A key element of our company is that simply we do not offer free proposals or estimates. Since our estimates are specific to your solution, full of important, expert driven information and technical detail it would not be cost effective for either party. By taking our time and not rushing it we can ensure you save costs later with a well thought out strategy. It's essential that all parties invest the time upfront the work calls for. 
</p>
<p>
By working with us you will do so knowing our value before any research and development begins. And if not, you will have a solid strategy of work that can be bid on with confidence.
</p>
<p>
We put a cost on our proposals and estimations allowing us the time to be thorough, disciplined, and methodical in analysing the work required, time scales, budget, and risk. Without this initial effort, and the time to be both curious and wary of any assumptions, a project is likely to run into blockers and issues.
